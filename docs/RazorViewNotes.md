## Razor View Notes

- Minimally Viable Product (MVP)
  - Start with the most basic product
  - Don't do async
  - KISS: Keep It Simple Stupid
- Why not use just list?
  - Creating Model as the List may change, keep dynamic
- Directives
- 3 Types of Razor Views
  - Partials
    - Can be nested infinitely
    - Used as mini-element templates to be used
    - Partials instead of Functions in HTML
  - Layouts
    - Can be changed with `ViewData[""] = "";`
    - The "buns" of the sandwich, always encompasses other views.
  - View
    - Complete page, linked from Controller action
  - Editor Templates
    - Functionally partials, but posts data back to the servers
